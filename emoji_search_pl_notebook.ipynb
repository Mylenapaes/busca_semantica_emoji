Entretanto, o seu uso pode ser diferenciado dependendo da cultura. Este projeto se concentra na busca semântica de emojis utilizando o LLM \"Llama 3\" da Meta e embeddings, assim, não há apenas o seu metadado, mas também a sua representação como embedding utilizando um transformador multilíngue, dessa forma, a busca pode ser realizada por mais 50 línguas e não se restringe apenas ao inglês. Ademais, através, do Qdrant é possível trazer ainda mais performance na pesquisa semântica."],"metadata":{"id":"QHQgoU5VotM9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vV8YzrXhZJ5X"},"source":["## Dependências"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"EVK18WvyZOqF"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import sys\n","from google.colab import drive"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1725365138976,"user":{"displayName":"Pedro Paulo Ayala Yamada","userId":"14979071029499270964"},"user_tz":180},"id":"75EpK-vIZOqG","outputId":"106f1d60-11ab-4993-c61c-149626fb2f64"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Python 3.10.12\n"]}],"source":["! python --version"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5,"status":"ok","timestamp":1725365138977,"user":{"displayName":"Pedro Paulo Ayala Yamada","userId":"14979071029499270964"},"user_tz":180},"id":"EVsccoinZOqH","outputId":"3addfc32-2b1d-4dc7-9801-98f4df810f1f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["unknown option --upgrade\n","usage: python3 [option] ...
