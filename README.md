## Description

Welcome to Emojeez ðŸ’Ž, an AI-powered semantic search application that helps you find emojis by entering text queries. This app supports multiple languages, making it versatile for global usage. The core of this app is rich semantic descriptions of emojis generated by an LLM (Llama 3 8B) and multilingual embeddings.  You can access the app online [here](https://emojeez.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- **Semantic Emoji Search**: Find emojis based on the meaning of words or phrases, with a focus on the common usage of the emoji by users rather than its ojective nature. The similarity search is enabled by the embedding-based vector database [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) and ðŸ¤— [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index).   
- **Multilingual Support**: Works with multiple languages via the use of mulitlingual sentence encoders to generate query embeddings in a multilingual representation space.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation, powered by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).



## Getting Started
