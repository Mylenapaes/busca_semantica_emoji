## 🪄 Core Features

 - **Advanced Semantic Emoji Search** 🔎 Utilize our embedding-based search algorithm to find emojis that best match the contextual meaning of phrases and commonly used expressions. This functionality is powered by the integration of [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)'s vector database and the powerful 🤗 [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) to build an efficient semantic search engine.

 - **LLM-Generated Emoji Descriptions** 🦜 Go beyond simple string matching and experience the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for better semantic search. Emojeez 💎 utilizes enriched semantic descriptions generated by Meta AI's Llama-3-8B model. These descriptions not only define each emoji and its symbolism but also provide better contextualization of its usage in today's text-based communication. For more information, see this 🤗 [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/badrabdullah/llm-emoji-dataset). 

- **Efficient Indexing for Thousands of Emojis** ✨  Explore more than 5000 emojis based on the most recent Unicode standards. While each emoji is searchable by its standard name, you can also discover emojis by their common usage in today's text-based communication. For example, the text query *great ambition* returns 🚀, while *idea* returns 💡.

- **Comprehensive Multilingual Support** 🌐 Discover emojis using your native language! This feature is facilitated by a Transformer-based multilingual encoder that supports over 50 languages.

- **Intuitive User Interface** Interact with 🖥️ Emojeez 💎 via an intuitive user-friendly interface built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
